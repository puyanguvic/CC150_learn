### Explanation of ((n & (n-1)) == 0)

This expression checks if the integer `n` is a power of 2. Specifically, it checks if `n` has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Bitwise Operation Explanation**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `n - 1` is the result of subtracting 1 from `n`, which flips the lowest set bit in `n` and all the bits to its right.
   - `n & (n - 1)` performs a bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n - 1`. If `n` is a power of 2, `n` has exactly one bit set to 1, and `n - 1` has all bits to the right of this bit set to 1.

2. **Operation Example**:
   - Suppose `n = 8`, which is `1000` in binary.
   - `n - 1 = 7`, which is `0111` in binary.
   - `n & (n - 1) = 1000 & 0111 = 0000`.

    ```plaintext
    n = 8:   1000
    n-1 = 7: 0111
    ---------------
    AND:      0000
    ```

   - For a non-power-of-2 number, e.g., `n = 10`, which is `1010` in binary.
   - `n - 1 = 9`, which is `1001` in binary.
   - `n & (n - 1) = 1010 & 1001 = 1000`.

    ```plaintext
    n = 10:  1010
    n-1 = 9: 1001
    ---------------
    AND:      1000
    ```

3. **Condition Explanation**:
   - When `n` is a power of 2, `n & (n - 1)` results in `0`.
   - When `n` is not a power of 2, `n & (n - 1)` results in a non-zero value.

### Code Explanation

This code checks if a number is a power of 2:

```cpp
if ((n & (n - 1)) == 0) {
    // n is a power of 2
} else {
    // n is not a power of 2
}
```

### Conclusion

- **((n & (n-1)) == 0)**: This expression checks if the integer `n` is a power of 2.
- When `n` is a power of 2, its binary representation has exactly one bit set to 1, so `n & (n - 1)` equals 0.
- When `n` is not a power of 2, its binary representation has more than one bit set to 1, so `n & (n - 1)` is not 0.
