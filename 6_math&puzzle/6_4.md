### Probability of Collision for Three Ants on a Triangle

Consider a triangle with vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). Each ant starts at a different vertex and chooses a direction to walk along the sides of the triangle. Each ant has an equal probability of choosing either direction.

For simplicity, let's denote:
- Clockwise direction as \(C\)
- Counterclockwise direction as \(CC\)

Each ant can independently choose either \(C\) or \(CC\), giving us a total of \(2^3 = 8\) possible combinations of directions for the three ants.

#### No Collision Scenarios

For the ants to avoid a collision, all ants must either:
1. All walk clockwise.
2. All walk counterclockwise.

These are the only two scenarios where no collisions occur. The probability of each scenario is:
- All clockwise: \(P(C, C, C) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}\)
- All counterclockwise: \(P(CC, CC, CC) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}\)

Thus, the total probability of no collision is:
\[ P(\text{no collision}) = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

#### Probability of Collision

Since the total probability must sum to 1, the probability of collision is:
\[ P(\text{collision}) = 1 - P(\text{no collision}) = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, the probability of collision for three ants on a triangle is \(\frac{3}{4}\).

### Probability of Collision for \(n\) Ants on an \(n\)-Vertex Polygon

For an \(n\)-vertex polygon, each ant can independently choose either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Therefore, there are \(2^n\) possible combinations of directions for the \(n\) ants.

#### No Collision Scenarios

For no collision to occur, all ants must either:
1. All walk clockwise.
2. All walk counterclockwise.

These are the only two scenarios where no collisions occur. The probability of each scenario is:
- All clockwise: \(P(C, C, \ldots, C) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{1}{2^n}\)
- All counterclockwise: \(P(CC, CC, \ldots, CC) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{1}{2^n}\)

Thus, the total probability of no collision is:
\[ P(\text{no collision}) = \frac{1}{2^n} + \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{2}{2^n} = \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \]

#### Probability of Collision

Since the total probability must sum to 1, the probability of collision is:
\[ P(\text{collision}) = 1 - P(\text{no collision}) = 1 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \]

So, the probability of collision for \(n\) ants on an \(n\)-vertex polygon is:
\[ P(\text{collision}) = 1 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \]

### Summary

- For three ants on a triangle, the probability of collision is \(\frac{3}{4}\).
- For \(n\) ants on an \(n\)-vertex polygon, the probability of collision is \(1 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\).
