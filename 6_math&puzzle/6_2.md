To determine which game to choose based on the probability \( p \) of making a shot, we need to compare the probabilities of winning each game.

### Game 1
In Game 1, you get one shot and you have to make it. The probability of winning Game 1 is simply \( p \).

### Game 2
In Game 2, you get three shots and you need to make at least two out of the three shots. We need to calculate the probability of winning Game 2.

To win Game 2, there are three successful scenarios:
1. You make exactly two out of three shots.
2. You make all three shots.

We can use the binomial distribution to calculate these probabilities.

#### Scenario 1: Exactly two out of three shots
The probability of making exactly two out of three shots is given by:
\[ P(\text{exactly 2 out of 3}) = \binom{3}{2} p^2 (1 - p) \]

#### Scenario 2: All three shots
The probability of making all three shots is given by:
\[ P(\text{all 3}) = p^3 \]

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{3}{2}\) is 3. Therefore, the probability of winning Game 2 is:
\[ P(\text{win Game 2}) = 3 p^2 (1 - p) + p^3 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
To determine for which values of \( p \) you should pick one game over the other, compare the probabilities:
\[ p \quad \text{vs.} \quad 3 p^2 (1 - p) + p^3 \]

### When to Choose Game 1 or Game 2
We need to find the values of \( p \) where:
\[ p = 3 p^2 (1 - p) + p^3 \]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[ 3 p^2 (1 - p) + p^3 = 3 p^2 - 3 p^3 + p^3 = 3 p^2 - 2 p^3 \]

Set the equations equal:
\[ p = 3 p^2 - 2 p^3 \]

Rearrange the equation:
\[ 0 = 3 p^2 - 2 p^3 - p \]
\[ 0 = p (3 p - 1 - 2 p^2) \]

We get:
\[ p (3 p - 1 - 2 p^2) = 0 \]

So, \( p = 0 \) or solve the quadratic equation:
\[ 2 p^2 - 3 p + 1 = 0 \]

Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[ p = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = 1 \).

\[ p = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 2} \]
\[ p = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}}{4} \]
\[ p = \frac{3 \pm 1}{4} \]

So, we get:
\[ p = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad p = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Conclusion
- If \( p < \frac{1}{2} \), the probability of making a single shot in Game 1 is higher than making at least two out of three shots in Game 2. Therefore, you should choose Game 1.
- If \( p > \frac{1}{2} \), the probability of making at least two out of three shots in Game 2 is higher than making a single shot in Game 1. Therefore, you should choose Game 2.
- If \( p = \frac{1}{2} \), both games have the same probability of winning, so either game can be chosen.

### Summary
- Choose Game 1 if \( p < \frac{1}{2} \)
- Choose Game 2 if \( p > \frac{1}{2} \)
- Either game if \( p = \frac{1}{2} \)
