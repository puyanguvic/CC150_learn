To determine if it's possible to cover an 8x8 chessboard with two diagonally opposite corners removed using 31 dominos, we need to consider a few properties of the board and dominos:

1. **Chessboard Coloring**: An 8x8 chessboard alternates between black and white squares. Removing two diagonally opposite corners (which are both the same color) leaves us with a board that has an unequal number of black and white squares. Specifically, since two corners of the same color are removed, we end up with 30 squares of one color and 32 squares of the other color.

2. **Domino Coverage**: A single domino covers two adjacent squares. No matter how you place a domino, it will always cover one black square and one white square on a standard checkerboard pattern.

### Key Observation

Given the unequal number of black and white squares remaining on the modified chessboard, it is impossible to cover the board with dominos. Here's why:

- **Counting the Squares**: Initially, the chessboard has 32 black squares and 32 white squares. Removing two diagonally opposite corners (both white or both black) results in:
  - 30 white squares and 32 black squares (if white corners are removed), or
  - 30 black squares and 32 white squares (if black corners are removed).

- **Domino Coverage Requirement**: Each domino covers exactly one black and one white square. Therefore, to cover the board entirely using dominos, the number of black squares must be equal to the number of white squares.

### Proof by Contradiction

1. **Initial Condition**: The 8x8 board has 32 black and 32 white squares.

2. **Removing Two Corners**: Removing two diagonally opposite corners, which are both of the same color, results in a board with 30 squares of one color and 32 squares of the other color.

3. **Domino Placement**: Since each domino covers one black square and one white square, you need an equal number of black and white squares to cover the board completely.

4. **Imbalance**: The modified board has an imbalance of colors (30 of one color and 32 of another), making it impossible to cover the board using 31 dominos.

### Conclusion

It is impossible to cover the entire modified 8x8 chessboard with two diagonally opposite corners removed using 31 dominos. The primary reason is that the board will have an unequal number of black and white squares after the corners are removed, which violates the requirement that each domino covers one black and one white square. This imbalance means that no matter how you try to place the dominos, you will always have leftover squares that cannot be covered.
